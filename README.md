# Self_Watering_Plant_Embedded

* Worked in a group of four to design, program, and implement a project where a PIC16F1829 Microcontroller was used to trigger 
a signal and open a valve to water a plant 

* Programmed analog to digital conversion of moisture sensorâ€™s resistance output with MPLAB X IDE and Snap programmer 
I2C communication printed water levels in soil onto an LCD and OLED screen for dynamic user interface which included 
moisture percent, temperature, and image interface for facilitated user interface 

* Output signal of 5v with GPIO pins onto a Solid-State relay to trigger 12v DC valve if moisture reading fell below threshold
